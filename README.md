# EEG-Based Mental State Classification
this repo contain a machine learning model that do inference in EGG signal to deduce emotions
The research and data are primarily sourced from the following studies:

- J. J. Bird, L. J. Manso, E. P. Ribiero, A. Ekart, and D. R. Faria, “A study on mental state classification using EEG-based brain-machine interface,” in 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems, IEEE, 2018.
